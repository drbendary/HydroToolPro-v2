| Callosal angle < 90° (on coronal MRI)                          | +2    |
| Periventricular hyperintensities (white matter changes)       | +1    |

## 🔁 Interpretation Guidance

- **Score ≥ 10** → ✅ High Likelihood of NPH — Consider shunt workup or referral
- **Score 6–9** → 🟡 Moderate Suspicion — Recommend further testing (tap test, advanced imaging)
- **Score < 6** → 🔻 NPH Unlikely — Consider alternative diagnosis
